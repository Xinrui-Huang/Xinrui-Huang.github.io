        		<h1>About</h1>
				<p>I'm currently a student in University of Toronto. My majors are Statistics and Acturial Science and I am planning to pursue a master's degree in Statistics after graduation.
				I am interested in application of statistics in finance and acturial science, so during last summer holiday I had an internship in an insurance company and it was a very interesting experience.
				My experience with Rcode is quite rich and I have done several projects with it since first year in university. This year I also started to learn Python and cpmpleted a project about logistics transportation system.
				Please feel free to contact me if you have similar fields of interest in statstics or exchange ideas about Rcode or Python
					During my free time, I like to cook and bake, and badminton is my favourite sport. I have been playing the piano for many years and I also play a little guitar.
					It will also be great if you wanna find a friend to talk about sports or music.</p>
